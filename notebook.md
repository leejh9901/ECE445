We sent an email to our project sponsor Kenny regarding our inquiries of the project and the design in general. 
After receiving Kenny's reply, we finalized on some of the aspects of the design:
1. Kenny presented a paper explaining that a separate ground plane can poetentially be unnecessary, but does have higher noise than if we had one. In the scope of our project, we decided to include the ground plane in order to eliminate potential noise issues. 
2. Our design will include three patches and a hub. One patch for the reference ground plane and the other two for the positive terminal of the voltage measurement. The hub will contain all the voltage processing, analog to digital conversion, and wireless transmission. 
3. We plan to replace the previous suction system by using clipping ECG patches, which enhances replaceability.
4. Retractable wires will be used in order to eliminate potential wire issues.
