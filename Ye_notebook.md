### 02/17/2022
#### \<Weekly meeting with TA Notes\>
#### Logistics
- Ask for suggestions for Design Document
- Talk with machine shop for some advices

#### Design Document (Meeting notes from team member)
1. Have the high level requirements be perfect
2. More feedback during the design document check
3. Verification for every subsystem —> talked about it during lectures
4. Self-explanatory
5. Visual aid: zoom it and provide more details
6. You can definitely change the products you use later, but make sure that the verifications and requirements are stable.
7. Be consistent with the format, spacing, and citation (IEEE), etc.
8. Make sure to cite the last semester’s project
9. Grading is pretty harsh.


### 03/08/2022
#### 1st round PCB design
1. Build the schematic of the design
2. Refine the PCB design and eliminate all errors

### 03/15/2022
#### Testing dev board functions
- Check functions of the dev board to make sure that it can process the correct signal
- I visited the lab with Halim to test whether we could get an ECG signal using the SEN-12650 board
- We mainly used the AD8232 chip inside the board, so we tested it and it worked well

### 04/08/2022
#### PCB soldering
- After receving all chips we needed, I went to the lab and help Halim with some solderings
- We also tested the PCB board to make sure all solderings were good
- After testing, we made some revisement to the design and had all functions worked
- PCB board done this week

### 04/20/2022
#### Data transmission
- After we could receive correct analog output, I built the connection between the computer and the PCB board
- We could receive digital data on the monitor with desired speed
- After some refinement, analog input to digital output part done

### 04/29/2022
#### Mock Presentation
- We made a mock presentation to TAs and received some feedbacks

### Presentation suggestions (from team member's notes)
1. Include HL requirement
2. Delete some too technical details
3. Ensure eye contact with the audience
4. Suggestion : dive straight into problem -> show tangling wires photo then provide solution -> as if you are selling this product
5. requirements and verification -> more photos and videos (visual material)
6. block diagram should be bigger
7. Requiment -> not necessarily word by word from the DD.
8. page number
9. whole presentation 20~25min (make it 20 since prof might ask questions)
